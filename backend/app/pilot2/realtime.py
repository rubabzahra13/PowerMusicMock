"""Supabase Realtime broadcasts.

When mail changes server-side (a Gmail push sync, a poll, or the AI finishing
a draft) we publish a small "workspace changed" event to a Supabase Realtime
channel. The dashboard subscribes to that channel and refetches through the
normal authed API, so the UI updates in ~1s without polling.

Design choices:
- **Broadcast, not postgres_changes.** We don't expose the `emails` table to
  the browser's Supabase client, so a broadcast channel avoids adding RLS +
  a Realtime publication on that table. The payload is only a nudge — never
  email content — so a public channel is fine.
- **Best-effort.** A Realtime hiccup must never break ingestion, so every
  failure is swallowed (the 30s poll remains the fallback).
- **Stdlib only.** Uses urllib so we don't add an HTTP dependency.
